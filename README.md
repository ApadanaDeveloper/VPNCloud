# VPNCloud 

VpnCloud is a high performance peer-to-peer mesh VPN over UDP supporting strong encryption, NAT traversal and a simple configuration. It establishes a fully-meshed self-healing VPN network in a peer-to-peer manner with strong end-to-end encryption based on elliptic curve keys and AES-256. VpnCloud creates a virtual network interface on the host and forwards all received data via UDP to the destination. It can work on TUN devices (IP based) and TAP devices (Ethernet based).
